# TailwindCSS Unexpected Styling Bug

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in TailwindCSS related to class ordering and the use of responsive modifiers.  The bug manifests as unexpected visual output when applying multiple classes that affect the same style properties (e.g., background color, padding).

## Bug Description

When applying multiple TailwindCSS classes to an element, the order of the classes can significantly affect the final rendered style.  This is because Tailwind applies styles sequentially.  A later class can override an earlier class, resulting in unexpected visual output. The same applies to responsive modifiers which can cause conflicts across different screen sizes.

## Reproduction

The `bug.js` file shows how unexpected styling can occur. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a solution to address this issue.

## Solution

To avoid these issues, carefully consider the order of your Tailwind classes. More importantly use the `@apply` directive to compose more complex styles. This method allows more control and avoids potential conflicts.
