```javascript
<div class="bg-gray-300 p-4">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code will render a gray background with padding. However, if you apply another class that modifies the background color or padding, it might not work as expected, resulting in unexpected visual outcomes. This is because Tailwind's utility classes are applied in the order they appear in the HTML.

For instance, adding `bg-blue-500` will override `bg-gray-300`:

```javascript
<div class="bg-gray-300 bg-blue-500 p-4">
  <p>This is some text.</p>
</div>
```

The order of classes can lead to unexpected styles, and is a common source of confusion.

Another example of unexpected behavior is when using responsive modifiers like `md:p-8`. Without understanding how Tailwind's responsive design works, you might accidentally create styles that conflict across breakpoints, generating undesirable visual output.
